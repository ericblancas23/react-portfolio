       <h3>Fundamentals</h3>
       <p>
       I will always keep expanding my horizons and paths on technology and computer science. 
As the tech field grows, and many new innovations are being created, my willingness to learn and broaden my skills as a developer grows as the year grows on. My fundamental is simple and that is to exchange, discover and apply new innovative ideas that come into play.
